I really thinking about teachers mind .. Are they really teacher??? or Are they ability to teaching student or think about student mind?? I'm worry about that ... and only  for this private student didnt get good job earlier after their completed graduation degree...

I want to share about 1 thing, 1 CSE student who are in 6th semister but still he didnt have any PC .. But he did good result ..Question is how teachers marking him ??

Yeah skill is everything, but question is about Good teaching .. Think about our best teachers, "we think teacher question is so hard and tricky, so its tough to pass" .. But LOL ... He just copied every 90% questions from internet ..

Is it their good quality to make question hard? Nope? Just "ajaira fakibaji .." That just cpy pasting ..

This is main problem in our Private Universities. And we r hamperred. only for teachers ..

I didnt mention any teachers.
